                Hi, I'm Drake

              I'm a first year Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. It's nice to meet you.

              On this website, you'll find more about my personal life and things I like to do outside of school and work.

            A Little Bit About Me

             This June, I've finally concluded my four year journey at Dr. Norman Bethune CI. I'm now bound for new five (hopefully) year voyage at the University of Waterloo studying Electrical Engineering. I'll admit, I feel a little nervous, a shred uneasy, but a bit excited. I look forward to learn more about AI and automation in particular.

             Outside of the classroom, you might find me in PAC playing pickup or holed up in my room playing Starcraft. I also love camping (give a shot at backcountry?) and traveling. I really enjoy contrasting cultures as well as trying all sorts of different foods. Next up on the itinerary is J̶a̶p̶a̶n̶, C̶o̶s̶t̶a̶ R̶i̶c̶a̶, Thailand or Spain.

             Switching topics, I try my best to dabble in as many areas as I can, since I don't know what tools I'll be using in the future quite yet. Some things I've found fun are web scraping and discord bots + AI. Currently, I'm thinking of updating this website with react. I'll admit my projects aren't very impressive, but I'm happy with them anyways.
