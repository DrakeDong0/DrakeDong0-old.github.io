# I'm still adding!

These are my projects that I've worked on in the past both in and out of school. To stay updated, here's [my github.](https://github.com/DrakeDong0)

## Devolotics

Devolotics is a high school robotics team from Dr. Norman Bethune CI that competes in the annual FTC Tech Challenge. I worked in outreach, including founding the Scarborough STEM Alliance, as well as in software for the drivetrain as I was a driver. Our team won first place overall in the Ontario Provincial Championships, advancing us to the World Championships in Houston. We were among eight teams to represent Canada, and were the first to ever advance this far in both the Toronto District School Board and as a public school team.
